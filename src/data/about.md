# Intro

I was born and live in Dalian, and I am currently a java engineer in Ipdchina. I like to study and understand some interesting things and try them out. I mainly use the java language, but also some Go and Python. I am introverted and prefer to stay at home rather than travel.

# Currently

In Ipdchina, I mainly use JavaFX and Eclipse RCP for development, and at the same time I study Japanese on weekends, trying my best to pass the Japanese exam.
